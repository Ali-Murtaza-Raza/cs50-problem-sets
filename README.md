# CS50 Problem Set Solutions – Ali Murtaza

This repository contains my solutions to selected problem sets from [CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/), Harvard University's renowned introductory course in computer science. All programs are written in C and demonstrate foundational computer science concepts.

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each folder corresponds to a week in the course and includes problem set solutions, organized by topic.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- **Week 1:** C syntax, loops, conditionals, math
- **Week 2:** Strings, ASCII, text analysis, encryption
- **Week 3:** Algorithms, sorting, data structures, voting systems
- **Week 4:** Memory, pointers, file I/O, image manipulation

## 🛠️ How to Compile and Run

Each file can be compiled using `make` (if using CS50 IDE or a compatible C environment):

```bash
make readability
./readability
