# Week 1 – C Basics: Mario & Credit

This folder contains my Week 1 problem set solutions from CS50x. The focus was on C syntax, loops, conditionals, and basic math.

## 🧩 Problems

- `mario.c`: Prints half-pyramids or full-pyramids of bricks, inspired by Super Mario.
- `credit.c`: Checks the validity of credit card numbers using Luhn's Algorithm.

## 🛠️ How to Compile

```bash
make mario
./mario

make credit
./credit
